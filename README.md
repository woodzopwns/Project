# Project

This project was developed for my Bachelors thesis. In it I designed and built a cheat detection system for the popular online video-game "OldSchool RuneScape".
It was designed to take publicly available player data (skills, activities etc.) and use them to predict whether or not the player was cheating.

This was a collaboration between myself and another group in the community, who provided me with the data and targets I needed to develop the algorithm. 
I then engineered the data to suit my project needs and began from there.

The project was a great success, and could predict with incredible accuracy whether or not a player was cheating, with a false-positive and false-negative rate of almost 0, 
the project was found to be incredibly useful. 
While I then sent the source code and data to the Jagex development team (who develop the game), they did not confirm whether or not they used it in their future development.
